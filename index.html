          <p class="p_modal"><i>The best days of my life were spent at TFFS between 1991 and 1995! I had moved from a drab city school and fell in love with the sense of space and the beauty of nature embracing us!<br>
The underlying philosophy of the ashram lent it a solid foundation in our upbringing, be it in the morning prayers at assembly, the lessons on Sri Aurobindo's writings, the meditation sessions at the Samadhi or the overall celebration of the art and culture as a way of life!
I cannot ever forget Joya Ma'am's contribution in shaping me into who I am today! Her love for me was special as I was a dancer. However, her compassion was universal and adorned with energy, enthusiasm, a sense of aesthetics, an open mind and an aspiration for perfection in all that she did... which was truly inspirational!<br>
After exploring the world of Hotel Management after my schooling for 4 years, I had the courage to finally discover my calling...teaching!
As I look back on this 25th year of my association with TFFS, I realize how much of The Mother's love and beauty, seen and experienced through the being of Joya Miss, has contributed to these many years of my life. I strive to share the same spirit in my job front, as I too, have grown into the role of the Head of Primary, at the Singapore International School in Mumbai, after a ten year stint at the Pathways World School in Gurgaon where I grew professionally from being a teacher to a Primary School Coordinator!<br>
I also feel fortunate to train IB school teachers as a certified IB Workshop leader and school visiting Team Member.<br>
My heart has grown with pride to see the school grow over the last 25 years in form and fashion and just as the spirit of Joya Miss is eternally present in every brick and every leaf in the school, so does she continue to live in my heart forever, like a beacon of wisdom and divine light.

I'm indebted to The Future Foundation School for showing me the right path in life and giving me the platform to hone my skills as a percussionist.<br>
I had started my school life in 1995 from Arun Nursery School and then studied in TFFS from Class I to XII. These 14 years of my school life made me whatever little I'm today.<br>
In TFFS, the relationship with teachers and students was something that I cherish and they were our second mothers. I still remember I used to take part in games and sports like chess, table tennis, cricket and music competitions etc.<br>
I started learning tabla in 1998 from the legend Late Pt Shankar Ghosh. I passed out from the school in 2009 and I started playing tabla professionally in concerts in India and abroad and could manage my academics aand tabla playing equally well.<br>
Presently, I'm a full time professional musician. Apart from classical concerts, I'm also associated with a fusion band called Indian Blue.

I have been a student of TFFS since Class 4, in 1996. From the start, our teachers encouraged an interest in various subjects, and I was drawn, over the next few years, particularly through classes 5, 6, and 7, towards history and biology. I found history to be particularly interesting, thanks to the wonderful teachers who taught and encouraged us all in that particular subject.<br>
After that, I deliberately chose to go into humanities after 10th, by which time I had decided to go into archaeology as a career.<br>
Today, I work as a research assistant in the department of archaeology at Deccan College Post Graduate and Research Institute. I work with animal bones and environmental reconstruction using data from Archaeological sites. I have worked on sites in different parts of India, from Gujarat, to Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Tamil Nadu. I also deliver lectures at different institutes in the country and have presented papers in International conferences from time to time. All this is thanks to those initial years in TFFS which helped build and sustain my interest in the subject, and the guidance I received from both my teachers and seniors, among many others, in following this goal.</i>

I am what I am because of my school and I am not saying it just for the sake of it. From being disciplined to having the guts to raise my voice against anything that is wrong, I have imbibed everything from my school. Apart from education, I got involved in various extra curricular activities which boosted my self confidence. Today I'm independent and self sufficient, all due to the blessings of the Divine Mother. I believed in her, and so did She. My parents gave me birth, good education and made me well mannered, my teachers nurtured me and made me self sufficient. Even today my visit to school is incomplete without a tight hug from my teachers. Fourteen years is just to count my attendance in Arun Nursery School and The Future Foundation Schol, because even today, I am not an alumnus, not an ex student. I belong to the family of Sri Aurobindo Institute of Culture...then, now and forever.</i><br>
